# cs416-final-project
This is the code warehouse for CS 416 final project

I plan to adopt the FRA REA Data Visualizer.
This project will be specificlly on accident cause and severity plots. 
Three main scenes:
- Front page (train operation image)
- Introduction (About the Visualization)
- Introduction of major accident cause groups
- Frequency vs. Severity plot
- Total Cars Derailed vs. Accident Cause
- Total Damage Cost vs. Accident Cause
- Findings and conclusions
- References

With all the filters applied. Basic filters: 
- Date
- Accident types
- Accident cause group

Other advanced filters (may save for the future):
- Track type
- RR class type
- RR class name
- Train type
- Track class
- Speed intervals
- Length intervals
