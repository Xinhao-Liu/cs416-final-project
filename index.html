                <h1>About the Visualization</h1>
                <h3><i>This visualization is an interactive slideshow that takes the user through the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) Rail Equipment Accident/Incident (REA) 
                    Data, focusing on introducing the five major accident cause categories from both frequency and severity perspectives using three visualizations.</i></h3><br />
                <h2>About the Dataset</h2>
                <p>The FRA REA dataset includes information on all rail accidents where the total monetary damage to track, equipment, or structures exceeds an FRA-specified 
                    monetary threshold. This threshold is periodically adjusted for inflation and is $12,000 in 2024. While the FRA REA dataset contains all types of train 
                    accidents, such as those involving freight trains, passenger trains, and yard/switching trains, and all types of accidents, including derailments, collisions, 
                    and grade-crossing accidents, this visualization focuses on Class I railroads freight train derailment accidents happend on mainline and siding tracks between 
                    1997-2023. However, users can still freely explore the distribution characteristics among the five categories by interacting with the webpage.</p><br />
                <h2>Template Scene</h2>
                <p>The use of CSS and FullPage.js provides a unified template for the interactive visualization. Each slide transitions in a consistent manner, maintaining 
                    uniform text elements (font size and family). Additionally, a navigation bar on the right side allows users to easily switch between slides. Tooltips 
                    appear when users hover over the navigation, adjusting the display parameters for each menu item.</p><br />			
                <h2>Annotations</h2>
                <p>Annotations have been strategically used across all three visualizations to highlight key data points and enhance interpretability. For the scatter plot 
                    visualization, annotations identify the average frequency and severity, and divided all causes into four quadrants. These annotations appear in 
                    the background of the plot with a lighter gray color, Similarly, the bar plots utilize annotations to mark significant data points, such as the highest
                    total number of cars derailed and cumulative percentage values, offering detailed insights directly on the visual elements.</p><br />
                <h2>Parameters and Triggers</h2>
                <p>Interactive parameters and triggers are integral to all three visualizations, enhancing user engagement and data exploration. In the scatter plot visualization, 
                    parameters for x and y coordinates are initially set to display average frequency and severity. As users hover over different points, tooltips are triggered, 
                    revealing detailed information about each derailment cause. Additionally, selecting different categories through the interactive legend filters the data points 
                    displayed, dynamically adjusting the visual representation.</p><br />
                <p>The bar plots incorporate similar interactive features. For the plot showing the total number of cars derailed, x-axis parameters are set to the different 
                    derailment causes, while the y-axis represents the total number of cars. Hovering over the bars triggers tooltips that display specific details about each 
                    cause, including a percentage. An additional secondary y-axis is used to visualize the cumulative percentage with a purple line, updating in 
                    real-time as users interact with the plot. The interactive legend allows users to filter the data by category, changing the color and visibility of 
                    the bars accordingly.</p><br />
                <p>These interactive elements and annotations collectively enhance the user's ability to understand and analyze the data, providing a comprehensive view of the 
                    derailment causes from multiple perspectives. The use of parameters and triggers ensures that the visualizations remain dynamic and responsive, allowing for 
                    an intuitive exploration of the dataset.</p>

                    <p>The Frequency vs. Severity plot is the first visualization in this interactive slideshow that introduces the causes of derailments. 
                        Presented by Dick et al. (2003) and Barkan et al. (2003), each derailment cause is plotted in terms of its average frequency and average severity. 
                        Dashed lines divide the graph into four quadrants: the horizontal line represents the average severity for all causes, and the vertical line represents 
                        the average frequency for all causes. Therefore, points to the right of the vertical line indicate above-average frequency, and points above 
                        the horizontal line indicate above-average severity. 
                        As shown, <b style="color: red;">Broken Rails or Welds</b> is the most frequent cause of derailments, while 
                        <b style="color: red;">Other Rail and Joint Defects</b> is the most severe cause, derailing an average of 18.5 cars.

                    <p>Besides using the average number of cars derailed to study the severity of derailment causes, focusing on the total number of cars derailed and the total 
                        monetary damage cost are two other commonly used metrics. In this slide, we delve into the total number of cars derailed.
                        Similar to the previous slide, <b style="color: red;">Broken Rails or Welds</b> again accounts for the largest number of derailed cars among all causes.
                        <b style="color: magenta;">Extreme Weather</b> ranks second, followed by <b style="color: red;">Buckled Track</b>.
                        However, <b style="color: red;">Other Rail and Joint Defects</b>, which was identified as "the most severe" derailment cause in the previous slide,
                        only accounts for 2.3% of all derailed cars, ranking 14th among all causes.

                    <p>The next metric used to measure the severity of derailment causes is the total monetary damage cost. This slide explores this aspect.
                        <b style="color: red;">Broken Rails or Welds</b> again causes the highest monetary damage, as expected. However, the second highest damage is caused by 
                        <b style="color: orange;">Broken Wheels</b>, and the third by <b style="color: magenta;">Extreme Weather</b>.
                        This highlights the importance of focusing on various metrics to fully understand the underlying nature of each derailment cause.

                <h1>Findings</h1>
                <p>In conclusion, this interactive slideshow introduces three common visualizations to help viewers understand derailment causes from both 
                    frequency and severity perspectives. All derailment causes are grouped into five major categories and 51 cause groups. Each major category is
                    consistently color-coded throughout the entire slideshow. Viewers can easily grasp the overall picture from the visualizations: <b style="color: red;">
                    Broken Rails or Welds</b> is the most frequent and severe derailment cause by all definitions. By interacting with the legend, viewers can also learn
                    that derailments caused by <b style="color: red;">Track</b> issues are generally more frequent and severe, while those caused by 
                    <b style="color: blue;">Human Factors</b> and <b style="color: orange;">Equipment</b> are less common on average, but their severity varies 
                    from cause to cause.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="summary_text2">
                <h1>Reminder</h1>
                <p>Lastly, this interactive slideshow can serve as a reference for understanding derailment causes in general. Many research studies focus on specific 
                    derailment causes, and conclusions can vary based on different contexts. Please be mindful and open-minded if you encounter different conclusions in 
                    academic papers on derailment causes and severity.
