                <h1>About the Visualization</h1>
                <h3><i>This visualization is an interactive slideshow that takes the user through the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) Rail Equipment Accident/Incident (REA) Data, focusing on introducing the five major accident cause categories from both frequency and severity perspectives using three visualizations.</i></h3><br />
                <h2>About the Dataset</h2>
                <p>The FRA REA dataset includes information on all rail accidents where the total monetary damage to track, equipment, or structures exceeds an FRA-specified monetary threshold. This threshold is periodically adjusted for inflation and is $12,000 in 2024. While the FRA REA dataset contains all types of train accidents, such as those involving freight trains, passenger trains, and yard/switching trains, and all types of accidents, including derailments, collisions, and grade-crossing accidents, this visualization focuses on Class I railroads freight train derailment accidents happend on mainline and siding tracks between 1997-2023. However, users can still freely explore the distribution characteristics among the five categories by interacting with the webpage.</p><br />
                <h2>Template Scene</h2>
                <p>The use of CSS and FullPage.js allows for a cohesive template look for the interactive visualization. Each page is transitioned using the same method, and text elements are kept consistent (font size and family). Additionally, there is a page navigation bar on the right side which allows users to skip between different slides. The tooltips that are triggered when a user moves their mouse over the navigation alter the display parameters for each navigation menu item.</p><br />			
                <h2>Annotations</h2>
                <p>Annotations have been used in all three visualizations with a similar process of using triggers to change the hidden paramenter of the annotation. For example, the Line Chart Visualization has an initial state of the hidden parameter which controls the display of the annotations set to false. As a user uses the brush bar to trigger changes to the line chart visualization x-axis parameters, it also changes this hidden parameter to true. In turn the annotations disappear until the user resets the brush bar to zero - thus zooming out back to the default visualization parameters.</p><br />
                <h2>Parameters and Triggers</h2>
                <p>Both parameters and triggers are used in all of the three visualizations. For the Bubble Chart Visualization, parameters for the x,y co-ordinates of each bubble are set to an initial central position for the All Reviews Visualization. As a user selects menu items to chose between All Reviews, Reviews by State and Reviews by Stars, it triggers the change of bubble’s x,y co-ordinates parameter to their respective groupings.</p><br />
                <p>In Zoomable Sunburst Visualization, each mouse click on a region is a trigger for the path and arc parameters. By clicking within a region, you can zoom into the data to take a look at the information underneath. Clicking the centre circle will trigger the parameters to return to its values one up in the hierarchy.</p><br />
                <p>For Line Chart Visualization, parameters are set for each Restaurant Category. These parameters are triggered to be updated as the mouse moves over the visualization, providing the user with a snapshot of the amount of check-ins in a given time. A secondary parameter and trigger set is the brush bar below the line chart. This bar allows the user to zoom into the data to show a closer look of the data. By clicking a set space on the brush bar, it triggers the x-axis parameter of the line chart to be updated to a ratio of the same selected section of the brush bar.</p>
